Composition Projects
--------------------

The following scores and recordings are courtesy of the student composers and professional performers as listed, and used with permission.

### Minuet And Trio For String Quartet, In Classical Style

Using models from the string quartets and other works by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, your work will explore the "rounded binary" form typical of the classical Minuet and Trio and the relationship of form, key and "tone" that characteristically exists between them.

These compositions were performed by an anonymous professional string quartet.

### Lied (Song) for Soprano and Piano

The models for this project are the songs of Schubert and Schumann.

Example poems that one might use as a song's text ([PDF](/courses/music-and-theater-arts/21m-303-writing-in-tonal-forms-i-spring-2009/assignments/MIT21M_303s09_assn05_poems.pdf))

The student songs were performed by visiting artists Janna Baty, voice, and Daniel Curtis, piano. After each performance, they also gave constructive feedback to each student.  For each song, video and audio recordings of the performance and feedback, along with most of the written scores, are linked in the following table.
